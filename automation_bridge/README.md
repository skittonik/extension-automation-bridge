# Automation Bridge Native API

The native extension registers a curl-friendly HTTP API on Defold's engine service web server:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:<engine_service_port>/automation-bridge/v2
```

API v2 standardizes scene-inspection terminology on **element** across endpoint
paths, capability names, response fields, ids, diagnostics, and input targets.

Find `<engine_service_port>` in the editor console line:

```text
INFO:ENGINE: Engine service started on port <port>
```

No Lua setup is required for scene inspection, input, screenshots, native
desktop video recording, the event cursor transport, or timeline markers.
Application-defined events, state, commands, annotations, and acknowledgements
use a debug-only Lua API that must be enabled explicitly:

```ini
[automation_bridge]
application_api = 1
event_capacity = 256
```

`event_capacity` is clamped to `16..4096` and defaults to `256`. Release builds expose neither the HTTP bridge nor the `automation_bridge` Lua module.

Query parameters remain available for curl-friendly requests. `POST` and `PUT`
also accept a root `application/json` object. JSON bodies are limited to 65,536
bytes and 16 nesting levels. Structured endpoints consume documented nested
fields (for example `point.x`/`point.y`); unsupported nested fields are validated
and ignored by flat v1 operations. Query values win if the same key is present
in both forms.

```sh
ENGINE_PORT=51337
BASE="http://127.0.0.1:${ENGINE_PORT}/automation-bridge/v2"

curl -fsS "$BASE/health" | python3 -m json.tool
```

## Response Shape

Success responses use this envelope:

```json
{ "ok": true, "data": {} }
```

Error responses use this envelope:

```json
{ "ok": false, "error": { "status": 409, "code": "stale_scene", "message": "..." } }
```

`error.status` is the logical API status. Defold's embedded DLIB HTTP server only
supports reason phrases for `200`, `302`, `404`, and `500`; other logical
error statuses are therefore transported as HTTP `500` to avoid an engine
warning without turning a failure into a successful response. Existing `404`
and `500` statuses remain unchanged. Clients should use `ok` and `error.status`
for the precise result; older and generic clients still receive a non-2xx
failure. See the repository-root `DEVELOPMENT.md` before changing this mapping.

Common error codes include `bad_request`, `invalid_json`, `json_body_too_large`,
`unsupported_media_type`, `not_found`, `method_not_allowed`, `body_not_supported`,
`stale_scene`, `stale_element`, `unsupported_key`, `input_queue_full`, `input_too_large`, `input_controller_busy`,
`input_device_unsupported`, `input_not_found`, `input_not_owned`, `pointer_closed`,
`screen_resize_unsupported`, `screenshot_unsupported`, `screenshot_not_found`,
`screenshot_storage_unavailable`, `screenshot_pending`, `recording_unsupported`,
`recording_active`,
`recording_inactive`, `recording_start_failed`, `recording_stop_failed`,
`metal_capture_unsupported`, `metal_capture_active`, `metal_capture_inactive`, and
`unsupported_capability`. The latter names a feature
omitted by the current platform, graphics, game-object, window, or HID backend.

## Coordinates

Input coordinates use top-left `window` pixels. All advertised spaces use a
top-left origin:

```json
{
  "coordinates": {
    "origin": "top-left",
    "units": "pixels",
    "input_space": "window",
    "spaces": ["window", "client", "backbuffer", "viewport", "normalized_viewport"]
  }
}
```

Game object bounds are projected from configured `display.width` and `display.height` space to the current window size. GUI bounds are reported in screen pixels.

`GET /screen`, `PUT /screen`, and `GET /health` return:

```json
{
  "window": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "width": 1280, "height": 720 },
  "client": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "width": 1280, "height": 720 },
  "backbuffer": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "width": 1280, "height": 720 },
  "display": { "width": 960, "height": 640, "scale": 2 },
  "project_content": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "width": 960, "height": 640 },
  "display_pixels": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "width": 1280, "height": 720, "scope": "window_drawable" },
  "viewport": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "width": 1280, "height": 720 },
  "coordinates": { "origin": "top-left", "units": "screen_pixels" }
}
```

`display` is retained for compatibility and describes configured project
content, not global monitor bounds. `display_pixels` is limited to the drawable
window because public Defold APIs do not expose monitor or decorated outer-window
rectangles.

## Elements

Element responses always include the basic fields:

```json
{
  "id": "e:0123456789abcdef",
  "snapshot_id": "e:0123456789abcdef",
  "scene_sequence": 42,
  "engine_frame": 810,
  "instance_id": "/player",
  "instance_generation": 7,
  "logical_id": "instance:0123456789abcdef:g7",
  "created_scene_sequence": 12,
  "name": "play",
  "type": "gui_node_box",
  "kind": "gui_node",
  "path": "/main[0]/hud[0]/play[0]",
  "parent": "e:0011223344556677",
  "visible": true,
  "enabled": true
}
```

Optional element fields include `text`, `url`, `resource`, `automation_id`, `localization_key`, `role`, `bounds`, `properties`, and `children`.

`bounds` has screen, center, and normalized center coordinates:

```json
{
  "bounds": {
    "screen": { "x": 440, "y": 300, "w": 160, "h": 48 },
    "center": { "x": 520, "y": 324 },
    "normalized": { "x": 0.40625, "y": 0.45 }
  }
}
```

Use `include` to choose optional blocks:

```text
include=bounds
include=properties
include=children
include=all
include=bounds,properties,children
```

Basic fields are always returned. Unknown include tokens are ignored. `bounds` are included by default when `include` is omitted. `/element` also includes `properties` by default. `/scene` always returns the recursive tree under `root`.

Element `type` examples include `collectionc`, `goc`, component resource types such as `spritec` or `labelc`, and GUI node types such as `gui_node_box` or `gui_node_text`. `kind` is a broader category: `collection`, `game_object`, `component`, `subcomponent`, `gui_node`, or `element`.

`id`/`snapshot_id` hash the traversal path and are stable only for the current
scene shape. Elements backed by a public Defold `HInstance` also expose the engine
identifier, allocation generation, a composed `logical_id`, and the first bridge
scene sequence that observed that generation. Collection-global qualification is
not available in public DMSDK yet; use application automation ids when project
semantics are required. Re-discover snapshot ids after scene changes.

## Endpoint Reference

### `GET /automation-bridge/v2/health`

Checks that the extension is running.

Response `data` includes:

- `version`: API version string.
- `debug`: `true`.
- `platform`: `macos`, `windows`, `linux`, `android`, `ios`, or `unknown`.
- `capabilities`: supported capability names for runtime health/lifecycle,
  diagnostics, scene inspection, screen/coordinate operations, input and input
  devices, events, markers, frame waits, application synchronization, screenshots,
  native video recording, and Metal GPU trace capture. Backend-dependent names are
  omitted when unavailable.
- `capability_versions`: capability-to-version map for feature negotiation.
- `native_version`, `api_version_min`, and `api_version_max`: native package and API compatibility information.
- `identity`: opaque engine instance, process id where portable, wall/monotonic start timestamps, hashed project identity, and hashed build-configuration identity.
- `backend`: graphics, HID, and headless availability.
- `lifecycle`: runtime registration, health, and initial-scene stages.
- `screen`: current screen metadata.
- `scene_sequence`: snapshot sequence number.
- `engine_frame` and `engine_instance_id`: native temporal and process-instance correlation.
- `input`: default device/visualization and supported input devices.

```sh
curl -fsS "$BASE/health" | python3 -m json.tool
```

The raw title, bootstrap path, executable path, and user paths are not returned.
`build_identity` is currently a non-secret configuration fingerprint rather than a
resource-content digest.

### `GET /automation-bridge/v2/lifecycle`

Returns ordered runtime stages with native monotonic timestamps. The
`initial_scene_ready` stage appears once a scene root is available.

```sh
curl -fsS "$BASE/lifecycle" | python3 -m json.tool
```

## Capability-Driven Backends

Health and lifecycle are independent of scene, graphics, screenshots, windows, and
HID. Capabilities are advertised only when their backing context exists. Calling an
omitted route returns logical status `501 unsupported_capability`, so CI can distinguish an unsupported
backend from a transient runtime failure. True `DM_HEADLESS` registration still needs
the public Defold debug transport proposed in the specification linked above.

### `GET /automation-bridge/v2/screen`

Returns named rectangles, display scale, scene sequence, engine frame, and the
coordinate convention.

```sh
curl -fsS "$BASE/screen" | python3 -m json.tool
```

### `PUT /automation-bridge/v2/screen`

Sets the native Defold window size and returns `requested`, `outcome`,
`window_matches`, `backbuffer_matches`, all named rectangles, scene sequence,
and engine frame. Outcomes are `already_correct`, `resized`, or
`requested_not_observed`. The latter still uses HTTP 200 and lets a client poll
`GET /screen` to impose its own timeout.

Query parameters:

- `width`, `height`: positive integer window size in screen pixels.

```sh
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE/screen?width=1280&height=720" | python3 -m json.tool
curl -fsS -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"width":1280,"height":720}' "$BASE/screen" | python3 -m json.tool
```

### `POST /automation-bridge/v2/coordinates/convert`

Converts `x`/`y` from `from_space` to `to_space`. Supported spaces are `window`,
`client`, `display_pixels`, `backbuffer`, `viewport`, and
`normalized_viewport`. World and GUI-layout transforms are intentionally absent
until the application publishes them or Defold exposes public transforms.

```sh
curl -fsS -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"point":{"x":0.5,"y":0.5},"from_space":"normalized_viewport","to_space":"window"}' \
  "$BASE/coordinates/convert" | python3 -m json.tool
```

### `GET /automation-bridge/v2/frame`

Returns the current `engine_frame` and `scene_sequence`. Poll this endpoint for
frame-relative waits; semantic completion should use application state/events.

### `GET /automation-bridge/v2/scene`

Returns the current runtime scene tree.

Query parameters:

- `visible`: optional boolean. Use `1`, `true`, or `yes` for true; any other present value is false.
- `include`: optional comma-separated include list.

Response `data` includes `count`, `visible_filter`, `screen`, `scene_sequence`,
`engine_frame`, and `root`.

```sh
curl -fsS "$BASE/scene?visible=1&include=bounds,properties" | python3 -m json.tool
```

### `GET /automation-bridge/v2/elements`

Searches elements with simple filters. This is the main discovery endpoint for automation clients.

Pagination values are validated: `limit` must be an integer from 0 through 500;
`offset` and `cursor` must be unsigned 32-bit integers. Malformed supplied values
return `bad_request`. A valid cursor takes precedence over a valid offset. Pages
are independent live snapshots; compare their frame and scene metadata.

Query parameters:

- `id`: exact element id.
- `type`, `name`, `text`, `url`: substring match, case-insensitive by default.
- `type_exact`, `name_exact`, `text_exact`, `url_exact`: case-sensitive exact match.
- `path`, `kind`, `instance_id`, `logical_id`: case-sensitive exact match.
- `automation_id`: exact application-supplied automation id.
- `localization_key`: exact application-supplied localization key.
- `role`: exact application-supplied semantic role.
- `visible`, `enabled`, `has_bounds`, `visible_and_enabled`: optional boolean filters.
- `case_sensitive`: make substring filters case-sensitive.
- `include`: optional comma-separated include list.
- `limit`: number of returned elements, clamped to `0..500`. Default is `50`. Use `limit=0` to get counts without element payloads.
- `offset` or numeric `cursor`: zero-based result offset.

Response `data` includes:

- `elements`: returned element list.
- `count`: returned element count after `limit`.
- `matched`: total matching elements before `limit`.
- `total`: total elements in the snapshot.
- `truncated`, `next_cursor`, and `offset`: explicit pagination state.
- `scene_sequence`, `engine_frame`, and `active_collections`: selector diagnostics.

```sh
curl -fsS "$BASE/elements?type=labelc&text=Play&visible=1&limit=20" | python3 -m json.tool
```

### `GET /automation-bridge/v2/element`

Returns one element in detail.

Query parameters:

- `id`: required element id.
- `include`: optional comma-separated include list. Defaults to bounds and properties.

```sh
curl -fsS "$BASE/element?id=e:0123456789abcdef&include=bounds,properties,children" | python3 -m json.tool
```

### Input ownership, FIFO execution, and receipts

All click, drag, path, pointer, and key actions share one FIFO. Only the first action advances during an engine update, so independent gestures cannot overwrite the same HID state. Every mutating request carries `client_id`, `session_id`, and `request_id`; keep ids compact on query endpoints because Defold bounds the complete request resource. The first client/session acquires the controller lease and other clients receive `input_controller_busy` until that lease expires. Observer endpoints remain readable without the lease.

Use `PUT /input/configure?client_id=...&session_id=...&lease=5&device=auto&visualize=1` to acquire or renew control and set defaults. Devices are exclusive per gesture: `auto`, `mouse`, or `touch`. `GET /health` reports `input.device.mouse` and, on platforms where native touch injection is supported, `input.device.touch`. The public Defold HID API has no reliable connected-touch-device predicate, so explicit touch is conservatively enabled on iOS and Switch and rejected elsewhere. Android uses Defold's mouse-compatible primary-pointer path because touch packets added from an extension update are cleared before the following script input dispatch; one gesture never injects both mouse and touch.

When resolving an element id, pass `expected_scene_sequence` to reject a changed
snapshot with logical status 409 `stale_scene`. Input receipts include the scene sequence
and engine frame used for resolution.

```sh
curl -fsS -X POST "$BASE/input/click?id=e:0123456789abcdef"
curl -fsS -X POST "$BASE/input/click?x=480&y=320&visualize=0"
```

Accepted input returns HTTP 200 with this lifecycle receipt in `data`:

```json
{
  "input_id": 42,
  "kind": "drag",
  "state": "accepted",
  "queue_position": 1,
  "accepted_frame": 120,
  "start_frame": null,
  "release_frame": null,
  "accepted_time_us": 123456789,
  "start_time_us": null,
  "release_time_us": null,
  "requested_duration": 0.35,
  "actual_duration": 0,
  "reason": null,
  "client_id": "runner-1",
  "session_id": "test-7",
  "request_id": "request-19",
  "engine_instance_id": "engine-123456",
  "scene_sequence": 8,
  "engine_frame": 120,
  "device": "mouse",
  "pointer_id": 0
}
```

Lifecycle terms are exact: `accepted` means queued, `started` means the first down/key event was injected, and `released` means the final up was injected. `cancelled` and `failed` are terminal and include `reason`. They do not claim that application code consumed or accepted the action.

Use `GET /input/status?input_id=42` for current/bounded-history status and `GET /input/pending` for the FIFO. `POST /input/cancel?input_id=42&release=1&client_id=...&session_id=...` cancels one action. `POST /input/flush?release=1&client_id=...&session_id=...` cancels the owning session's active and later actions. `release=1` releases mouse/key state or emits a cancelled touch contact. A pointer or controller lease expiry performs the same safe cleanup.

Element-targeted input accepts `expected_scene_sequence`. A mismatch returns logical status 409 with `stale_scene` before resolving a snapshot/path element id. Receipts retain the scene sequence used for resolution plus engine instance/frame metadata.

For protection that survives ordinary frame/snapshot advancement, element-targeted
clicks also accept `expected_logical_id`; element-targeted drags accept
`expected_from_logical_id` and `expected_to_logical_id`. If a path-derived element id
now belongs to a different runtime instance, the request returns logical status 409 with
`stale_element` before input is queued.

### `POST /automation-bridge/v2/input/click`

Use `id`, or finite `x`/`y`. Optional common fields are `device`, `pointer_id`, `visualize`, `expected_scene_sequence`, and the ownership/correlation fields above. `modifiers` holds up to four comma-separated key names (e.g. `modifiers=KEY_LSHIFT` for shift-click) as a chord for the whole gesture: pressed one engine update before the pointer goes down and released one update after it comes up, re-asserted every update while the event plays. Accepted names are the same as the `keys` parameter's special keys; unknown names, an empty list, or more than four return an error instead of silently tapping unmodified.

```sh
curl -fsS -X POST "$BASE/input/click?id=e:0123456789abcdef&client_id=runner&session_id=test&request_id=click-1"
```

### `POST /automation-bridge/v2/input/drag`

Use `from_id`/`to_id`, or `x1`/`y1`/`x2`/`y2`. `duration`, `hold_before`, and `hold_after` are seconds in `0..60`; their total must not exceed 60. `easing` is `linear`, `ease_in`, `ease_out`, or `ease_in_out`. `modifiers` works as on `/input/click` (e.g. `modifiers=KEY_LCTRL` for ctrl-drag), held across the whole down/move/up.

```sh
curl -fsS -X POST "$BASE/input/drag?x1=100&y1=100&x2=500&y2=300&duration=.35&easing=ease_in_out&client_id=runner&session_id=test"
```

### `POST /automation-bridge/v2/input/drag_path`

Runs exactly one down, a continuous native path, and one up. `points` contains `x,y` pairs separated by semicolons. For `path=sampled` or `linear`, `durations` and `easing` have one comma-separated value per segment. `path=quadratic` requires three control points and one duration/easing; `path=cubic` requires four. Paths contain 2–128 points, the encoded point list is limited to 8192 bytes, and total duration including holds is at most 60 seconds. Visualization records and draws positions actually injected on engine updates, including the sampled curve, rather than drawing only a start/end chord. `modifiers` works as on `/input/click`, held across the whole gesture.

```sh
curl -fsS -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"points":"100,100;180,60;260,140","durations":".15,.22","easing":"ease_in,ease_out","hold_before":.08,"hold_after":.04,"client_id":"runner","session_id":"test"}' \
  "$BASE/input/drag_path"
```

### Low-level pointer sessions

`POST /input/pointer/open?x=...&y=...&pointer_lease=2...` creates a leased pointer receipt. `modifiers` works as on `/input/click`, held for the whole session until the pointer releases. Append continuous work with `/input/pointer/move?input_id=...&x=...&y=...&duration=...&easing=...` and `/input/pointer/hold?input_id=...&duration=...`; finish with `/input/pointer/up?input_id=...`. Every command includes the same client/session identity and renews `pointer_lease`. If the client disappears, expiry emits a safe release/cancel. `POST /input/cancel` closes a session immediately.

### `POST /automation-bridge/v2/input/key`

Use `text` for literal UTF-8 or `keys` for one or more brace-wrapped special keys such as URL-encoded `%7BKEY_ENTER%7D`. Values are limited to 4096 bytes. Supported names cover every named key in the engine's `dmHID::Key` enum: arrows, modifiers, navigation keys, `KEY_F1`–`KEY_F12`, `KEY_A`–`KEY_Z`, `KEY_0`–`KEY_9`, punctuation and symbol keys (`KEY_EQUALS`, `KEY_MINUS`, `KEY_COMMA`, `KEY_PERIOD`, `KEY_SLASH`, brackets, and the rest), keypad keys (`KEY_KP_0`–`KEY_KP_9`, `KEY_KP_ADD`, ...), and lock/system keys (`KEY_CAPS_LOCK`, `KEY_PAUSE`, `KEY_LSUPER`, ...). Unknown or malformed brace-wrapped names return `unsupported_key` instead of producing a successful no-op receipt. Braces supplied through `text` remain literal. `hold` keeps each special key pressed for that many seconds (`0..60`, default `0` -- a single-update tap) before releasing it; it applies per `{KEY_...}` token, the combined hold across all tokens must stay within 60 seconds, and it requires at least one special key (literal text cannot be held). While held, the key is re-asserted every engine update, so bindings receive the same continuous per-frame actions a physically held key produces; progressing key events keep controller ownership through their bounded release without an indefinitely renewable hold, and the receipt's `requested_duration` reports the total requested hold. Key presses share the FIFO, report the same receipts, and cancellation releases an active special key. `modifiers` holds up to four comma-separated key names as a chord across the press (e.g. `keys=%7BKEY_Z%7D&modifiers=KEY_LCTRL` for ctrl-Z), pressed one update before the first key and released one update after the last; it composes with `hold`, requires at least one special key (literal text cannot be chorded), and is advertised as the `input.modifiers` capability. The receipt echoes `modifier_count` so a client can tell a chord was honoured. `GET /health` advertises `input.key` capability version `2` for full named-key and hold support; clients must negotiate `input.key>=2` before sending `hold`.

### `GET /automation-bridge/v2/screenshot`

Schedules an atomic post-render PNG capture. `after_frames` may defer capture by
up to 600 rendered callbacks. The accepted receipt includes a `capture_id` and
must be completed through the status endpoint; file size polling is not a
completion protocol. PNG rows use the same top-left window orientation as input,
scene bounds, and coordinate conversion responses.

```sh
curl -fsS "$BASE/screenshot" | python3 -m json.tool
```

Response `data`:

```json
{
  "capture_id": 7,
  "state": "pending",
  "path": "/tmp/automation-bridge/screenshot-123-7.png",
  "engine_frame": 810,
  "scene_sequence": 42,
  "width": 1280,
  "height": 720,
  "format": "png",
  "sha256": null,
  "failure_reason": null
}
```

### `GET /automation-bridge/v2/screenshot/status`

Takes `capture_id` (or `id`) and returns `pending`, `complete`, or `failed`.
Completed receipts include capture frame/sequence, dimensions, and SHA-256. The
PNG is first written to a temporary path and atomically renamed before `complete`
is visible. On Android the path is inside the application's writable internal
data directory.

## Native video recording (macOS and Windows)

The extension selects its own largest on-screen window, resolves the matching
`NSWindow` content frame, and records only that undecorated game area with
ScreenCaptureKit's native H.264 MP4 recorder on macOS 15 or newer. The explicit
source rectangle excludes the title bar and rounded window corners. It does not
launch FFmpeg or any other helper process. Screen Recording permission is
granted to the running game process; the first request may cause the system
permission prompt.

On Windows 10 version 1903 or newer, the extension selects the largest visible
top-level window owned by the current Defold process, captures it with Windows
Graphics Capture, and crops frames to its Win32 client area. Windows 11 corner
rounding is disabled for the recording session and restored afterward. Frames
are resized as requested and encoded to H.264 MP4 with Media Foundation. The
Windows backend is currently video-only; `audio=true` returns
`recording_audio_unsupported` instead of recording another audio source.

- `GET /recording/capabilities` reports runtime availability, output format,
  codec, resizing, frame-rate, and application-audio support.
- `GET /recording/status` reports the active or most recently finalized capture.
- `POST /recording/start` accepts `path`, optional paired `width` and `height`,
  integer `fps` from 1 through 60 (default 30), and boolean `audio` (default
  true on macOS and false on Windows). It automatically selects a window owned
  by the current process. It returns as soon as capture is live and does not wait
  for the first frame: on Windows that wait happened on the engine thread, which
  then could not present the window the capture takes its frames from. Read
  `frame_count` from `/recording/status` or from the stop metadata for evidence
  that frames were actually written.
- `POST /recording/stop` stops capture and waits until the MP4 is finalized.

```sh
curl -fsS -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"path":"/tmp/game.mp4","width":960,"height":540,"fps":30,"audio":true}' \
  "$BASE/recording/start"

curl -fsS -X POST "$BASE/recording/stop"
```

## Application synchronization

The application channel is optional. Core scene inspection and native input work without application changes. All names are limited to 128 bytes and use letters, numbers, `_`, `-`, `:`, and dot-separated namespace segments. Project-prefixed names such as `my_game.operation_complete` are recommended to avoid collisions.

Application JSON is limited to 32 KiB and 16 nested array/object levels. Commands call registered functions only; there is no endpoint for arbitrary Lua evaluation.

### Application catalog

`GET /application/catalog` requires `application.catalog` (version 1), advertised
only when `application_api = 1`. It lists all registered commands, published
states, and explicitly declared state/event contracts. Undocumented registrations
have an empty `contract`. Declare metadata from Lua after registering a command:

```lua
automation_bridge.describe("command", "my_game.load_fixture", {
    description = "Load a fixture and return its name when ready.",
    input_schema = { type = "object", properties = { name = { type = "string" } }, required = { "name" } },
    output_schema = { type = "object", properties = { loaded = { type = "string" } } },
})
automation_bridge.describe("state", "my_game.ui", {
    description = "Current workflow state; published whenever the step changes.",
    schema = { type = "object", properties = { busy = { type = "boolean" } } },
})
automation_bridge.describe("event", "my_game.operation_complete", {
    description = "Emitted after completion with the caller's operation_id.",
    schema = { type = "object", properties = { operation_id = { type = "string" } } },
})
```

The kind is `command`, `state`, or `event`. Metadata accepts only `description`
(1-4096 bytes), command `input_schema`/`output_schema`, or state/event `schema`.
Schema roots must be objects with string keys or booleans. They are application
documentation: the bridge does not validate payloads against JSON Schema or fetch
schema references. The existing JSON size/depth limits apply to each complete
contract, with at most 256 declarations per engine instance. Repeating a kind/name
replaces its complete metadata. Metadata is cleared with the Lua application
lifecycle. An event declaration does not emit an event; a state may be described
before its first publication. Document timing and correlation rules in descriptions.

The endpoint accepts exact `kind`/`name` filters, `limit` (default 50, range 0-100),
`offset` (default 0), and a decimal string `cursor` that takes precedence over
offset. Invalid supplied pagination values return logical `400 bad_request`.
The response data is `{entries: [{kind, name, contract}], count, matched, offset,
next_cursor, revision, engine_instance_id}`. A zero limit returns only metadata
and counts. `next_cursor` is null when there is no continuation. Each page is
consistent; restart pagination when revision or engine identity changes.
Revision changes on registration, first state publication, metadata replacement,
or Lua teardown, rather than on every state value update.

### Structured events and cursors

Applications emit typed JSON from Lua:

```lua
automation_bridge.emit("my_game.operation_complete", {
    operation_id = "op-42",
    success = true,
})
```

`GET /events/cursor` returns the next cursor and the oldest retained cursor. `GET /events?cursor=N&limit=100` returns entries at or after `N` at once: HTTP handlers run on the engine thread, so a server-side wait would freeze the game it waits for. `timeout_ms` is still accepted and ignored; clients poll (the Python `EventStream.poll()` does). Each event includes `sequence`, `type`, `name`, JSON `data`, engine `frame`, `native_timestamp_us`, `engine_instance_id`, and `scene_sequence`. `recording_timestamp_us` is present for recorder-correlated markers.

The event ring is bounded. A cursor older than `oldest_cursor` returns `overflow: true`, the retained range, and no silent cursor advancement. Clients must explicitly decide whether to fail or resubscribe.

### Published state

```lua
automation_bridge.publish("my_game.ui", {
    busy = false,
    workflow_step = "ready",
})
```

`GET /state` returns all latest values plus the global `revision`. `GET /state?name=my_game.ui` selects an exact state name. `GET /state/wait?after_revision=12` returns the publications newer than that revision at once, for the same reason; `timeout_ms` is accepted and ignored, and `wait_for_state()` polls. Every state includes its own revision, frame, and native timestamp, so a wait can require a publication newer than the state it already observed.

### Named commands

```lua
automation_bridge.command("my_game.load_fixture", function(data)
    load_fixture(data.name)
    return { loaded = data.name }
end)
```

Submit commands in a JSON body. The `data` field is itself a string containing
strict JSON:

```sh
curl -fsS -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"name":"my_game.load_fixture","data":"{\"name\":\"standard\"}","timeout_ms":30000}' \
  "$BASE/commands" | python3 -m json.tool
```

Query parameters remain supported for short curl requests, but clients should
use the body because Defold bounds the complete request resource. The HTTP 200
response contains a command id. Poll `GET /commands?id=<id>` for `pending`,
`running`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`, or `timed_out`, plus the JSON
result or error. `DELETE /commands?id=<id>` cancels only pending work. Lua
callbacks run on the engine update thread and cannot be safely preempted; a
running cancellation returns logical status `409 command_not_cancellable`.

### Native delivery and application acknowledgement

Native input receipts describe only bridge lifecycle stages such as accepted, started, and released. An application can separately report its semantic decision:

```lua
automation_bridge.acknowledge_input(input_id, {
    accepted = false,
    reason = "input_locked",
})
```

Acknowledgements are retained as `type="acknowledgement"`, `name="input.acknowledged"` events whose data contains `input_id` and `result`. They do not claim which script consumed an action. Automatic propagation of a native injection id into Defold's Lua input action is not currently available.

### Semantic annotations

Rendered text does not reveal a localization key. Applications can annotate a public scene-element URL instead:

```lua
automation_bridge.annotate("main:/ui#status", {
    automation_id = "operation_status",
    localization_key = "status_ready",
    role = "status",
})
```

Annotations are copied into matching scene snapshots and can be queried with the exact `automation_id`, `localization_key`, and `role` element filters. Metadata is application-owned and disappears when the engine instance exits.

### Timeline markers

Use a JSON body to insert a `marker` event without constraining marker data to
the request-resource limit:

```sh
curl -fsS -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"name":"workflow_started","data":"{\"case\":7}","recording_timestamp_us":1234}' \
  "$BASE/markers" | python3 -m json.tool
```

Native monotonic time is always recorded. The optional recording timestamp is
caller-supplied, allowing a client to correlate markers with its own media or
trace clock. Native video recording does not add this correlation automatically.

## Metal GPU trace capture (macOS)

### `/automation-bridge/v2/metal`

Captures complete rendered frames to a Metal `.gputrace` on macOS when Defold is using the Metal graphics adapter. Launch the engine with `METAL_CAPTURE_ENABLED=1`; the parent directory of the requested output path must already exist.

Schedule a one-frame capture:

```sh
curl -fsS -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"path":"/tmp/fontgen.gputrace"}' \
  "$BASE/metal" | python3 -m json.tool
```

Use `frames` to capture more than one frame:

```sh
curl -fsS -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"path":"/tmp/fontgen.gputrace","frames":60}' \
  "$BASE/metal" | python3 -m json.tool
```

`POST` returns HTTP 200 with state `pending`. Capture starts at the next pre-render callback and stops after the requested number of post-render callbacks. Poll status with:

```sh
curl -fsS "$BASE/metal" | python3 -m json.tool
```

Request an early stop with:

```sh
curl -fsS -X DELETE "$BASE/metal" | python3 -m json.tool
```

Status data includes `state` (`idle`, `pending`, `capturing`, `complete`, `canceled`, or `failed`), `path`, `frames`, `frames_captured`, `stop_requested`, and `error` when startup failed.

#### Analyze the capture with `gpudebug`

Apple's `gpudebug` command-line tool can replay and inspect the resulting trace without opening Xcode's graphical Metal debugger. It is part of the newer Apple GPU command-line tooling and requires an Xcode/macOS combination that provides it. Check availability first:

```sh
xcrun --find gpudebug
man gpudebug
```

If `xcrun` cannot find it, use a newer Xcode and macOS release that includes `gpudebug`, or open the `.gputrace` in Xcode instead.

Start an interactive session:

```sh
gpudebug -t /tmp/fontgen.gputrace
```

At the `gpudebug>` prompt, begin by exploring the trace:

```text
status
list
go commands
list --all
```

Navigate into a command buffer, render or compute encoder, and draw or dispatch shown by `list`. The exact names depend on the trace:

```text
go cb0/re0/draw0
info
info pipeline
go vertex
list --all
go ..
go fragment
list --all
```

Useful commands include:

- `list` or `list --all`: show children and the actions available for each entry.
- `go <name-or-path>`: navigate through command buffers, encoders, draws, dispatches, bindings, API calls, and resources.
- `info` or `info <child>`: inspect draw/dispatch arguments, encoder state, pipeline state, resource metadata, and bindings.
- `find <text>`: search labels, names, and summaries throughout the trace.
- `next` and `prev`: step between neighboring draws, dispatches, or other sibling entries.
- `fetch <attachment-or-resource>`: export a texture, buffer, attachment, or counter series for external inspection. For example, `fetch color0` writes the selected draw's color attachment to an image file.
- `profile`: inspect or collect GPU profiling data when supported by the replay device.
- `help` and `<command> ?`: discover commands and command-specific options.

A practical visual-debugging sequence is:

```text
go commands
list --all
go cb0/re0/draw0
info pipeline
fetch color0
next
fetch color0
```

Compare fetched attachments before and after suspicious draws, and inspect the pipeline plus vertex/fragment bindings where the output first changes incorrectly.

For scripted analysis, create one persistent session and reuse the session id printed by the first command:

```sh
gpudebug -t /tmp/fontgen.gputrace -c "list"
gpudebug -s 412 -c "go commands/cb0/re0/draw0" -c "info pipeline"
gpudebug -s 412 -c "fetch color0"
gpudebug --terminate 412
```

Replace `412` and the entry path with values reported for your trace. Reusing a session avoids loading and preparing the trace for every command.

For a single isolated query:

```sh
gpudebug --oneshot \
  -t /tmp/fontgen.gputrace \
  -c "go commands/cb0/re0/draw0" \
  -c "info pipeline"
```

The root normally exposes `commands`, `performance`, `api_calls`, and `resources`. Prefer following the actions printed by `list` rather than assuming a particular command-buffer or draw path.
